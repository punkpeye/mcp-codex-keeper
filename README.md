# Aindreyway MCP Codex Keeper

![MCP Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-Server-blue)

An intelligent MCP server that serves as a guardian of development knowledge, providing AI assistants with curated access to latest documentation and best practices.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Just tell your Cline/Sonnet assistant to add this to the configuration:

```json
"aindreyway-codex-keeper": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "--node-arg=--max-old-space-size=256", "@aindreyway/mcp-codex-keeper@latest"],
  "disabled": false
}
```

That's it! The assistant will handle everything automatically.

> **Note:** This server uses `npx` for direct npm package execution, which is optimal for Node.js/TypeScript MCP servers. While some MCP servers use `uvx` (Python-based), we chose `npx` for better integration with the npm ecosystem and TypeScript tooling.

## 🎯 What Your Assistant Can Do

Ask your assistant to:

- "Show me the latest React documentation"
- "Find best practices for TypeScript development"
- "Update documentation for Node.js"
- "Search for information about async/await"
